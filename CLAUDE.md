# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

**WorldSimulator** — god-game world simulator, mixing **Creatures** (individual
genetics, simple neural-net brains, needs-driven behaviour) with **WorldBox**
(sandbox scale: god powers, terrain, civilizations, chaos).
Stack: C++23 · Vulkan 1.4 · GLFW 3.4 · CMake 4+ + Ninja · Clang.

Engine plumbing (`engine/renderer`, `engine/ui`, `InputSystem`, `Logger`) was
bootstrapped from a sibling project, **Podjezd** (`../Podjezd`) — a mature
first-person-horror Vulkan engine. Only the generic rendering/windowing/input
layer was reused; `Application` and the camera were rewritten from scratch for
a top-down god-camera instead of Podjezd's FPS mouse-look. Podjezd's
audio (FMOD), physics (AABB character controller), network, and procgen
(stairwell generator) modules were **not** carried over — none of that logic
applies here yet. AlphaCraft (`../AlphaCraft`, voxel/Perlin-terrain engine)
was surveyed but not used; may be worth revisiting for terrain generation
later.

## Build

```bash
cmake --preset debug       # → build/debug/
cmake --preset release     # → build/release/

cmake --build --preset debug
cmake --build --preset release

./build/debug/game/worldsim
```

`WSIM_AUTOEXIT=1` — auto-quits after 5s (non-interactive smoke test of the
full init → render → shutdown cycle).

After first configure, `build/debug/compile_commands.json` → LSP resolves
include paths correctly.

## Architecture

```
engine/
  core/        Logger.hpp (header-only, C++23 std::print)
               InputSystem.hpp/.cpp — keys, mouse delta, mouse buttons, scroll
               Application.hpp/.cpp — game loop (fixed 60 Hz + variable render)
  renderer/    Window.hpp/.cpp — GLFW wrapper
               VulkanContext.hpp/.cpp — Vulkan init, swapchain, sync objects,
                 scene pipeline, MSAA, RT shadows (graceful fallback if
                 ray_query unsupported), FSR/NIS upscalers — all inherited
                 from Podjezd, currently unused/dormant except MSAA
               Camera.hpp — OrbitCamera: pivot point (target) + yaw/pitch/
                 distance; same CameraData UBO contract as Podjezd's FPS
                 camera, so VulkanContext needed zero changes
               Mesh/GpuBuffer/ObjLoader/SceneObject/Transform/AABB/Frustum —
                 generic mesh/scene plumbing
  ui/          ImGuiLayer.hpp/.cpp
game/
  main.cpp     entry point
assets/
  shaders/     inherited wholesale from Podjezd (scene/blur/composite/vision/
               FSR/NIS/RT) — generic rendering utilities, no game content
  fonts/       LiberationSans-Regular.ttf (ImGui)
```

## Camera (god camera)

`OrbitCamera` (`engine/renderer/Camera.hpp`) orbits a movable pivot
(`m_target`) instead of Podjezd's free-fly FPS camera:
- **WASD** — pan the pivot (camera-relative flat XZ, speed scales with
  distance so zoomed-out panning is faster)
- **Right-mouse-drag** — orbit (`yaw`/`pitch`, pitch clamped `[-85°, -20°]` —
  always looking down, never below horizon or near-vertical)
- **Scroll wheel** — zoom (`distance`, clamped `[4, 200]`)

`InputSystem` gained `isMouseButtonDown()` and `scrollDY()` on top of
Podjezd's key/mouse-delta tracking. The scroll GLFW callback is installed
*before* `ImGuiLayer` so Dear ImGui's own `install_callbacks=true` chains to
it correctly (ImGui saves+calls the previously-registered callback). Window's
`glfwSetWindowUserPointer` already holds the `Window*` for resize handling,
so `InputSystem`'s scroll callback uses its own single-instance static
pointer instead (the whole engine assumes exactly one window/one
`InputSystem`).

## Current state / TODO

- [x] Engine bring-up: window, Vulkan context, ImGui, orbit camera, flat
      ground plane, fixed-timestep loop
- [ ] Procedural terrain (heightmap or voxel — AlphaCraft's Perlin/chunk code
      may be a starting point)
- [ ] God-power tools (raise/lower terrain, spawn/remove creatures, click
      interactions)
- [ ] Creature entities: needs (hunger/energy), movement, simple behaviour
- [ ] Genetics: genes, inheritance, mutation on reproduction
- [ ] Neural-net brain per creature (Creatures-style, trained/evolved in-game)
- [ ] Civilization-scale systems (out of scope until the above lands)

## Key conventions

- Namespace `wsim::` for all engine/game code (renamed from Podjezd's `pdz::`
  when the engine was forked).
- Include paths: `${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/engine` → `#include "renderer/Window.hpp"`,
  `#include "core/Logger.hpp"`, etc.
- `Logger` is header-only; `engine_renderer` includes it via include path,
  does not link `engine_core` (avoids circular dependency).
- Shaders compile automatically to `build/*/shaders/*.spv`; path passed via
  `WSIM_SHADER_DIR` (`target_compile_shaders()` in root `CMakeLists.txt`).
